    "Ensemble techniques in machine learning combine multiple models to improve the performance of a system compared to any individual model on its own. The core idea is that by combining several models, the system can better capture the underlying patterns in the data and reduce errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common types of ensemble methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):** This involves training multiple versions of the same model on different subsets of the training data and then averaging their predictions. A well-known example is Random Forest, which uses bagging with decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boosting:** This technique sequentially trains models, each attempting to correct the errors of the previous one. Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stacking:** In this method, multiple models are trained to make predictions, and their outputs are then used as inputs to a second-level model, which makes the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Voting:** This approach involves combining the predictions of multiple models (which can be of different types) by taking a majority vote (for classification) or averaging (for regression).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Reduction of Overfitting:** Single models, especially complex ones, can overfit the training data, meaning they perform well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Ensembles, particularly bagging methods like Random Forest, can mitigate overfitting by averaging out the predictions of multiple models, which tends to smooth out the noise and capture the true signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robustness and Stability:** Ensemble methods are often more robust and stable than individual models. They are less sensitive to the peculiarities of the training data, meaning that small changes in the data are less likely to significantly affect the performance of the model.\n",

    "**Handling Different Types of Errors:** Different models may make different types of errors. By combining them, ensembles can balance out these errors, leading to a more reliable overall prediction.\n",

    "**Robustness:** They tend to be more robust to overfitting and noise in the data.\n",

    "**Resource Constraints:** When computational resources are limited, or when we need a quick solution.\n",

    "**Small Datasets:** When the amount of training data is limited, a well-regularized individual model might be more effective.\n",
