    "**Computationally Intensive:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: KNN requires calculating the distance between the query point and all points in the training set, which can be slow for large datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Description: In high-dimensional spaces, the distance between points becomes less meaningful, which can degrade the performance of KNN.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Description: KNN can be heavily influenced by irrelevant or noisy features.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Description: KNN may struggle with imbalanced datasets where some classes are underrepresented.\n",
